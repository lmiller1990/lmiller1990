### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lachlan and I am a [Vue.js team member](https://github.com/vuejs) focused on building testing tools for the Vue.js ecosystem. My main libraries are [Vue Test Utils](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-next) and [Vue Jest](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-jest).

If you or your company finds Vue Test Utils valuable, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/lmiller1990) in developing it. As my sponsors grow, I'll be able to spend more time on Vue Test Utils, from adding features to fixing bugs and writing guides to help make testing Vue.js applications a breeze. In addition, you get access to my paid content on my [GH sponsors page](https://lachlan-miller.me/gh-sponsors/dashboard).

To learn more about Vue, testing and JavaScript in general, take a look at my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydNBt-h2Cox_Ub_GzspneQ?view_as=subscriber). Also check out my ebook, the [Vue Testing Handbook](https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/v3/), which is available for free, or [Design Patterns for Vue.js 3](https://lachlan-miller.me/design-patterns-for-vuejs), which introduces some concepts for writing highly testable, modular code for your Vue applications.
