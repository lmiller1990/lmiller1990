### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lachlan and I'm a full stack developer. My open source contributions and expertise are primarily focus on the JavaScript ecosystem, relating to [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress), [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/), React.js and Node.js. Two of my most well known libraries are [Vue Test Utils](https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils) and [Vue Jest](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-jest). 

I also am passionate about education and mentoring. Take a look at my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydNBt-h2Cox_Ub_GzspneQ?view_as=subscriber). I've also published a book, [Design Patterns for Vue.js 3](https://lachlan-miller.me/design-patterns-for-vuejs), which introduces some concepts for writing highly testable, modular code for your Vue.js applications.

I am next available for work starting January 2024.
