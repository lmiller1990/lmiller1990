### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lachlan and I am a [Vue.js team member](https://github.com/vuejs) focused on building testing tools for the Vue.js ecosystem. My main libraries are [Vue Test Utils](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-next) and [Vue Jest](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-jest).

If you or your company finds Vue Test Utils valuable, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/lmiller1990) in developing it. As my sponsors grow, I'll be able to spend more time on Vue Test Utils, from adding features to fixing bugs and writing guides to help make testing Vue.js applications a breeze.

For more on Vue and Testing, I have some paid video content on my [website](https://vuejs-course.com) and free content on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydNBt-h2Cox_Ub_GzspneQ?view_as=subscriber), as well as the [Vue Testing Handbook](https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/v3/).
